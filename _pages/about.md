<b>I am a first year PhD student at the [School of Cybersecurity and Privacy](https://scp.cc.gatech.edu/) in the College of Computing at Georgia Tech. My advisor is [Prof. Vassilis Zikas](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~vzikas).
My research focuses on privacy-preserving machine learning and applied cryptography.
I am currently working on auditing differentially private mechanisms, with the broader goal of strengthening privacy and security guarantees in real-world AI systems while maintaining practical utility and accuracy.

<b>Before this, I was a software engineer at JPMorgan Chase and Co. where I was contributing to research projects with the J.P. Morgan AI Research team, particulary the [AlgoCRYPT COE](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/about/technology/research/ai/algocrypt-center-of-excellence) under the mentorship of [Dr. Antigoni Polychroniadou](https://antigonip.github.io/). 

<b>I completed my Bachelors of Technology in Computer Science from Vellore Institute of Technology in 2023.
