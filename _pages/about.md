<b>I am a first year PhD student in the [College of Computing](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/) at Georgia Tech, where I am advised by [Prof. Vassilis Zikas](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~vzikas).
My research primarily focuses on privacy-preserving machine learning and applied cryptography.
I am currently working on validating claimed differential privacy guarantees of a mechanism in a black-box way to ensure fair auditing. 

<b>Prior to starting my PhD, I was a software engineer at JPMorgan Chase and Co. where I was contributing to research projects with the J.P. Morgan AI Research team, particulary the [AlgoCRYPT COE](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/about/technology/research/ai/algocrypt-center-of-excellence) under the mentorship of [Dr. Antigoni Polychroniadou](https://antigonip.github.io/). 
I graduated with a Bachelors of Technology (B.Tech) in Computer Science from Vellore Institute of Technology, India in July 2023.

<b> I am broadly interested in enhancing privacy and security in real-world AI systems. I aim to integrate privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) in distributed systems to protect sensitive data, while maintaining practical utility and accuracy.
